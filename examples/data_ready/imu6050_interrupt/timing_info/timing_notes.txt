The info in this folder shows how GPIO lines can be used to provide timing
information for an oscilloscope display. Most any relatively inexpensive
USB scope could be used for this purpose.

Note: I use interrupt handler and interrupt service routine interchangeably.

Please refer to the timing*.png image files.

Images timeing1 & timing2 (expanded):
------------------------------------
The top blue trace (active high) shows the amount of time that the program is
processing the IMU data. The red trace (ative low) shows how long the interrupt
is active for. The interrupt is cleared by the interrupt handler's read. Note
how the data transfer time has been transferred to the ISR.

timing3*.img
------------
This image show the interrupt signal in relation to the ISR. The ISR is
active immediately, the data ready signal drops when the data registers are
read.

timing4*.img
------------
This image shows the ISR in red and background processing in blue. There is no
maningful background processing so the data is processed immediately after the
ISR has staged it. This is not always the case.

timeing5*.img
-------------
Here we commented out two lines of the interrupt configuration code to diable
latching and clearing on any data read. By clearing latching the interrupt is
just a 50us pulse that doesn't require clearing. Here the interrupt request
(IRQ) is just a pulse that clears just as the handler starts to run. This is
the simplest in terms of clearing the interrupt as long as your hardware and
cabling supports the short pulse.
